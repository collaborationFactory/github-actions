⛰ Purpose & Impact

Implement automated Jest test coverage quality gates in our PR pipeline to prevent non standard code from being merged, reducing production incidents and improving developer productivity.



🔬 Problem Hypothesis: Frontend developers lack visibility into test coverage adequacy when submitting PRs, causing uncertainty about code quality and anxiety during deployments.



⚡️Risk of not implementing: Inconsistent code quality standards, and accumulating technical debt that will slow future development.



Solution Sketch: GitHub Actions workflow that runs Jest coverage on affected Nx monorepo projects, enforcing configurable thresholds (80% lines/statements, 75% functions, 70% branches) and blocking PRs that don't meet standards.

[PR Pipeline] → [Run Jest Tests] → [Check Coverage Thresholds] → [Pass/Fail PR]
🎯 Measuring Success: Test coverage: 80% line coverage across frontend projects

Sonarqube incidents: 30% reduction over 6 months

Developer satisfaction: 20% improvement in quality process satisfaction scores
